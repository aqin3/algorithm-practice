# Algorithm

# Search

## Linear Search

Examine all indexes, from the beginning index to the last index

## Binary Search

Examine the array that is sorted, by set the low and high index then find the mid index between the two, if the mid point is not the answer then find out if the answer is lower or higher than the mid point (binary search array has to be sorted first) then set the low or high to the mid index

## Interpolation Search

Like binary search but random

# Sort

## Bubble Sort

Individually compare to the adjacent index

## Quick Sort

Set a pivot and run through each index, if the index is less than the pivot then continue the count but if the index is more then stop count then run to the next index if it is less comparing to the pivot then change its index with the previos more index
